## Chapter 5: Eshu’s Parable of the Toad

The night was spiraling, the vodka flowing like a river, the air thick with smoke and resentment. Eshu lit another cigarette, his eyes glinting in the dim light.

> “You wanna hear a story, brothers?” he asked, his voice low, dangerous.

Yan nodded, his face flushed, his eyes glassy. Petr rolled his eyes but leaned in, curious despite himself. Maria was silent, her head resting against the couch, her eyes closed. I didn’t say anything — just waited, the void humming louder.

> “Once upon a time,” Eshu began, his voice slow, hypnotic, “there was a Jew. A real Jew, not like the ones you see in the movies. This guy — he loved toads. Fucking obsessed with them. Woke up every morning, kissed his wife, then went straight to the swamp to jerk off to the slimiest one he could find.”

Yan burst out laughing, spilling his drink. Petr snorted, shaking his head.

> “You’re disgusting, Eshu.”

Eshu ignored him, leaning forward, his voice dropping lower.

> “Now, this Jew — he wasn’t just a pervert. He was a scholar. Studied the Torah, prayed every day, kept kosher. But the toads… they were his secret. His sin. And one day, an Arab shows up — big guy, beard down to his chest, carrying a scimitar. Says, ‘I heard you’re the best Jew around. Prove it.’  
> The Jew panics, right? He’s got a toad in his pocket, still sticky from the swamp. So he pulls it out and says, ‘This is my God.’  
> The Arab laughs, cuts the toad in half, and says, ‘Your God’s dead. Now what?’”

The room was silent, the weight of the story sinking in. Yan’s laughter died in his throat. Petr looked uneasy, his fingers twitching. Maria’s eyes opened, just a sliver, watching Eshu.

*“What they called betrayal was just a shift in gravity,”* I thought, the words a cold comfort. Eshu’s stories were never just stories — they were knives, cutting through the bullshit to the bone.

> “And the Jew?” I asked, my voice rough. “What’d he do?”

Eshu grinned, his teeth sharp in the light.

> “He picked up the pieces of the toad, ate them, and said, ‘Now my God’s inside me. You can’t kill what I carry.’ Then he walked away, leaving the Arab standing there like a fucking idiot.”

Yan whistled, low and impressed. Petr muttered,

> “That’s fucked up.”

Maria’s lips moved, but no sound came out.

*“Silence does not erase — it archives,”* I thought, watching her. She was carrying her own toads, her own gods, and we were all trying to cut them out of her.

Eshu turned to me, his eyes boring into mine.

> “What’s your toad, Iuda? What’s the slimy little fucker you’re carrying around?”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to. He already knew.
