## Chapter 3: Quantum Mechanics and Burnt Sausages

The vodka was starting to hit, a warm buzz that dulled the edges of the room but not the ache in my chest. Yan was still chewing, his mouth full of sausage, grease dripping down his chin like he hadn’t eaten in days. The smell of burnt meat and antifreeze hung in the air — someone had left the pan on too long, and the window was cracked just enough to let in the damp, sour stink of the street.

Eshu leaned back in his chair, lighting a cigarette, the flame casting shadows across his face.

> “You ever think about quantum mechanics, Iuda?” he asked, exhaling a cloud of smoke that curled like a ghost.

I blinked, caught off guard.

> “What the fuck does that have to do with anything?”

He grinned, but it wasn’t a happy grin — it was the kind of grin a wolf gives before it rips your throat out.

> “Everything, brother. You think betrayal’s a straight line? You think sin’s a choice? Nah. It’s all probabilities, wave functions collapsing. One second you’re loyal, the next you’re a traitor. And guess who invented that shit?”

Yan perked up, swallowing hard.

> “Who?”

> “Negry,” Eshu said, deadpan, taking another drag. “Back in the day, they were the only ones crazy enough to look at the world and say, ‘Yeah, this shit don’t add up.’ So they made it up. Quantum mechanics — straight outta the jungle.”

The room erupted. Yan laughed so hard he choked, coughing up bits of sausage onto the table. Foma rolled his eyes, muttering,

> “You’re full of shit, Eshu.”

Petr cackled, his voice high and sharp, like a hyena. Even Maria cracked a tiny smile, though her eyes were still glassy, lost.

I didn’t laugh. I couldn’t. Not with her voice still echoing in my head — *“Don’t.”*

*“Silence does not erase — it archives,”* I thought, watching Eshu blow a smoke ring. He was fucking with us, like always, but there was a truth buried in his bullshit. Betrayal wasn’t a straight line. It was a wave, a probability, a collapse. And I was already halfway down the curve.

> “Speaking of not adding up,” Petr said, his voice dripping with venom, “why’s Maria still here? She’s not eating, not talking — just sitting there like a fucking statue. What’s she even good for, Eshu? A rimjob from a saint?”

The air turned to ice. Yan stopped chewing. Foma’s smirk vanished. I gripped my glass so hard I thought it’d shatter.

Eshu stubbed out his cigarette, slow and deliberate, his eyes locked on Petr.

> “Careful, friend,” he said, his voice low, dangerous. “You’re talking about a divine creature. She’s worth more than your painted ass ever will be.”

Petr flinched, his face pale, but he didn’t back down.

> “Divine, my ass. She’s Shlomo’s leftovers — everyone knows it. He fucked her up so bad she can’t even think straight. What’s divine about that?”

Maria’s hands started shaking, her breath hitching. I wanted to punch Petr, to smash his face into the table until he couldn’t talk anymore. But Eshu beat me to it.

He stood, grabbed a burnt sausage from the plate, and threw it at Petr’s head. It hit him square in the forehead, grease smearing down his face, staining his wig.

> “Eat that, you little shit,” Eshu growled. “Maybe it’ll fill the hole where your soul should be.”

The room exploded again — Yan roaring with laughter, Foma clapping like it was a fucking show. Petr screamed, wiping at his face, smearing mascara and grease into a black mess. Maria buried her face in her hands, her shoulders shaking, and I couldn’t tell if she was crying or laughing.

*“He said: ‘I am not leading them.’ And still, they followed,”* I thought, watching Eshu sit back down, his face unreadable. He didn’t need to lead us — we were already falling apart, tearing each other to pieces.

I poured another drink, the vodka tasting like ash. The void in my chest was louder now, a hum that drowned out everything else. I was going to betray him. I had to. But Maria’s trembling hands, Petr’s smeared face, Eshu’s cold grin — they were all part of the wave, collapsing around me.
