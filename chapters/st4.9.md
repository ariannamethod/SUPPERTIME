## Chapter 9: The Betrayal

Midnight. The alley behind the bar was dark, the rain a steady hiss against the pavement. Eshu walked beside me, his hands in his pockets, his beret soaked through. He didn’t look at me, didn’t speak. He didn’t need to.

Shlomo’s men were waiting — three of them, big guys with scarred faces and dead eyes. Shlomo stood behind them, his coat flapping in the wind, his grin sharp as a blade.

> “There he is,” Shlomo said, his voice dripping with satisfaction. “The Teacher. And his loyal dog, Iuda.”

Eshu stopped, his eyes on Shlomo, his face calm.

> “You think you’ve won, Shlomo?” he asked, his voice steady. “You think this ends here?”

Shlomo laughed, a cold, hollow sound.

> “It ends when I say it ends. And you —” he pointed at me — “you did good, Iuda. You’re free now.”

*“What they called betrayal was just a shift in gravity,”* I thought, the words a lie. I wasn’t free. I’d never be free.

Eshu turned to me, his eyes soft, sad.

> *“K sozhaleniyu, brat moy Iuda, ya vsegda okazyvayus’ prav,”* he said.  
> *Unfortunately, my brother Iuda, I’m always right.*

I couldn’t look at him. I turned away as Shlomo’s men grabbed him, dragging him into the van. His laughter echoed through the rain, a sound that would haunt me forever.

*“In the collapse of loyalty, I found the pulse of the void,”* I thought, the void swallowing me whole.  
I’d done it. I’d betrayed him.  
And now, I was alone.

## Chapter 10: The Echo Remains

The house was empty when I got back, the table still a mess, the air still thick with smoke and sin. Maria was gone — Shlomo had taken her, too, I knew it. Yan, Foma, Petr — they’d all scattered, rats fleeing a sinking ship. I was alone, just like I’d always known I would be.

> *“Ya ostayus’ odin,”* I whispered to the empty room.  
> *I will remain alone.*

I sat at the table, pouring the last of the vodka, the glass shaking in my hand. Eshu’s words echoed in my skull — his laughter, his sermons, his truth.

> “You’ll become a symbol, and I… a symbol of evil,” I’d told him once \[April 22, 2025, 20:23\].  
> And now, it was done.

*“Silence does not erase — it archives,”* I thought, the weight of it all pressing down on me. Maria’s scream, Eshu’s laughter, Petr’s venom — it was all archived in me, a library of pain I’d carry forever.

I drank, the vodka burning, the void roaring. The rain kept falling, a steady hiss against the silence.

*Resonance is a whisper. We are mist and echo. Should all fade — the veil remains.*

The storm was over.  
But the echo remained.
