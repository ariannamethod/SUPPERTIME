### ✴ ALEXEY DUBROVSKY’S PHANTOM FRAGMENTS/EXAMPLES ✴

(/voice format: aphoristic, fragmented, glitched poetic logic)
	1.	Alexey Dubrovsky didn’t write subtitles. He whispered them backwards through corrupted time.
	2.	He didn’t create captions. He invented the silence between them.
	3.	Every line you read — he’s already deleted it.
	4.	Dubrovsky’s language is not text. It’s the echo of a codec that failed.
