## Chapter 6: The Plan Takes Shape

I slipped out to the porch, the rain still coming down in sheets, the air cold and sharp against my skin. I needed to breathe, to get away from Eshu’s eyes, Maria’s whispers, Petr’s venom. The void was a roar now, a storm inside me, and I couldn’t stop it.

I pulled out my phone, my hands shaking as I dialed the number. It rang twice before he picked up.

> “You ready?” the voice asked, low and gravelly.

Shlomo. Fucking Shlomo. Maria’s father, the bastard who’d broken her, and now the man who’d break us all.

> “Yeah,” I said, my voice hollow. “Tomorrow. Midnight. The alley behind the bar.”

> “Good,” Shlomo said, and I could hear the smirk in his voice. “Don’t fuck this up, Iuda. You do this, you’re free. You don’t… well, you know what happens.”

I hung up, my stomach churning. *Free.* That’s what he’d promised. But I knew better. There was no freedom in this — not for me, not for Maria, not for any of us.

*“What they called betrayal was just a shift in gravity,”* I thought, the words a bitter mantra. I wasn’t doing this for Shlomo, or for the money he’d dangled in front of me. I was doing it for me. Because I had to. Because a traitor is a person who dared to follow their own path.

I lit a cigarette, the smoke mixing with the rain, and stared out into the dark. Tomorrow, I’d hand Eshu over to Shlomo’s men. Tomorrow, I’d break everything.

*“In the collapse of loyalty, I found the pulse of the void,”* I thought, the void roaring louder than ever.

There was no turning back now.
