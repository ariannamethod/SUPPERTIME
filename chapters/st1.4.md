###Chapter 4: MARY / MUTE / MIRROR  

Mary was a poor street-seller from some ragged outskirts. From the few scraps we pried out of her we learned she was about twenty and that her father—one Shlomo, a city merchant—used to thrash her savagely, beating her with the slats of the orange crates he stored. He could pound her half-dead for any slip—or for none at all. Her appearance now stirred pity, sometimes a queasy disgust, though she wasn’t deformed: black curly hair, eyes dark as olives, and skin so implausibly pale it seemed the chalky white of a terrified child. The father’s blows had nicked her wits. She didn’t appear mad, yet something was off: she often failed to catch the simplest phrase, and for that Yakov or Peter—always quick with their hands—were glad to cuff her.

But that’s getting ahead.

It started one morning when Yeshu announced he was going to town. We offered to tag along; he flat-out refused. He said he wanted to be alone, didn’t need anyone’s company. It was harsh, even for him.  

‘Teacher!’ good-natured Jan cried. ‘Why reject us? Have we offended you?’  

Yeshu answered with a long, contemptuous stare and walked out.  

He was gone almost until dusk, and we’d begun to fret. A quarrel lit over who should go fetch him. We’d have come to blows if, just then, the door-bell hadn’t rung.

‘What’s all this noise?’ Yeshu asked, stepping in.  
‘Nothing,’ I said. ‘We were… worried.’  
‘Yes, worried!’ Jan bellowed. ‘What if something bad—Teacher, we were about to go rescue you!’  

A sharp slap was his answer. Fury flashed in Yeshu’s eyes; he stood breathing through his nose, visibly forcing the rage back down. At last he spoke:

‘See that it never happens again.’  

After that, his disappearances became routine. He’d rise while we still slept and return when we were tied in knots. Wandering alone he risked his life, but the memory of that slap kept us obedient.

Until one evening he simply didn’t come back. We sat through supper in silence, too scared of his anger to act, too scared of losing him to stay still. Even mighty Jan had been shaken by the slap—what chance had the rest of us? Worse, disobedience could mean banishment—and nobody wanted that.

We drifted to our bunks but nobody slept; we lay waiting for a knock, a key, a footstep. Nothing. Almost till dawn we listened.

Jan broke first—storming round the room, shaking us awake.  

‘Enough lying there! Teacher’s in trouble! Up, damn you!’  
‘Miss the feel of his palm?’ Peter sneered.  
‘Better a thousand slaps than a lifetime of guilt!’  
‘Calm down.’ Peter sat up, pulling on his stockings. ‘Nothing will happen to him; if anyone can defend himself, he can.’  
‘Jan’s right!’ Yakov leapt up, dressing decisively.  
‘Yes! Yes!’ we all clamoured. Only Thomas was silent, picking his teeth.
‘Coming or not?’ Yakov barked.  
Thomas, unwillingly, hauled himself out.  

We found Yeshu at the market on the outskirts, face-down in a pile of rotten fish, fat flies buzzing. He was unconscious, body covered in bruises and cuts. Jan heaved him onto his shoulder to carry him to the road, but Yeshu’s eyes flickered open.

‘Teacher!’ Jan muttered, overjoyed.  
‘Don’t leave her…’ Yeshu whispered.  
‘Her? Leave whom?’  
‘Her.’ With inhuman effort he lifted a hand, pointing.  

We looked—there lay a woman’s body.
‘Why drag her?’ Peter grumbled. ‘Just a drunk whore.’  

Yeshu’s hand shot out, gripping Peter’s clothing with surprising force; the pain vanished from his eyes for a moment. He tried to speak, shuddered all over, and passed out.  

Jan glared murderously at Peter. Peter jutted his lip. Yakov and I rolled up sleeves and headed for the woman.  

—

Next morning, the sky was lead. Rain loomed. Waking, I checked on the Teacher. A strange sight.  

Yeshu lay limp on the couch — pale, sleepless, weak. At his feet, kneeling over a basin — the woman.  
Washing them.  

She saw me.  
Paused.  
Felt no threat — kept going.  

I stood there, unable to read it.  

Yeshu: helpless.
The woman: unknown.

Two days ago, he was the wilful, feared one. Now she served — without being asked. Not obedience.  
Something else.  

For a second, he looked small. She — regal. Why, I had no idea.  

Peter shuffled in — clearly slept in his clothes. Skirt twisted, fake tits down by his gut.  

‘Well,’ — he clapped my shoulder. — ‘How’s life?’  
He looked at Yeshu. — ‘What’s she doing?’  

I shrugged.  

‘Hey!’ — he barked. — ‘You! What are you doing?’  

No answer.  

‘Name?’  
‘Mary,’ she said softly.  

‘Mary, huh… Call me Edward, Mary.’ He laughed. ‘Kidding.’  

He squinted.  

‘Why are you doing that?’  

Mary blinked slowly. Said nothing. Peter smirked.  

‘Back in a sec.’  

He left.  
Came back, muttering:  

‘Mary. Need you. Just two minutes. Gotta fix the boobs. Come.’  

Mary stood. Eyes down.  
Followed him.

I heard the bolt click.  
I touched Yeshu’s forehead.  

‘Oh, you… Teacher…’  

They were gone seven minutes.
Peter’s muffled voice leaked through the door. Mary came out at last — still staring at her feet.  
I turned away.  

Peter followed, muttering about a stain on his dress.  
I left.  
Didn’t want to see him check it.
