Chapter 1: The Rain Smells Like Betrayal (with Lilit)

In the rain that night, I heard a silence that spoke louder than betrayal.
The key growled in the lock, and the door swung open to Yakov’s pissy little sneer—dressed like a goddamn peacock in a tux and bowtie, the pretentious fuck.
“Well, shit, it’s you,” he grumbled, staring at my boots like they’d personally spat on his mother.
“Yeah, hello to you too, asshole,” I shot back, peeling off my soaked coat. The rain outside was a bitch, a relentless downpour that left me drenched from head to toe, my socks squelching like I’d waded through a sewer.
“Take your fucking shoes off,” Yakov barked. “You’ll track mud everywhere, and I’m not cleaning up your mess. I know you don’t give a shit, but I do.”

I rolled my eyes, kicking off my boots and socks, the cold parquet creaking under my bare feet as I stepped inside. The air was thick with tension, the kind that makes your skin crawl.
“Come on, move your ass,” Yakov muttered, still bitching. “Everyone’s here. Even Petr, the drama queen.” He smirked, and I could feel the venom in it.
“How’s the Teacher?”
Yakov shrugged, his face sour. “Dunno. He’s in a mood. Says he’s got a bad feeling or some shit.”
“About what?”
“How the fuck should I know?” Yakov snapped, his voice sharp enough to cut glass. “If I knew what went on in his head, I’d be the goddamn Teacher, wouldn’t I?”

That was Yakov for you—obsessed with cleanliness and kissing Eshu’s ass, but underneath it all, there was this dark, jealous rot. He’d never admit it, but you could smell it on him, like stale cigarettes and regret.
I walked into the living room, the floor groaning under me, and threw out a half-hearted, “Peace to this house!” I scanned the room, taking in the sorry lot of us.

They were all there. Foma sat off to the side, sneering like he was above it all, the smug bastard. Andrei was quiet as usual, a mouse in a room full of wolves. Maria was passed out on the couch, her breathing soft, her face pale like a ghost’s. I lingered on her for a moment, my chest tightening, then forced myself to look away. Petr was in full form—decked out in a gaudy dress and a wig, puffing on a cigarette with those manicured fingers, his face blank as a fucking wall. God only knew why Eshu kept him around, but who was I to judge?

Petr’s eyes were locked on Maria, and I knew exactly what he was thinking. The prick was jealous of her, always had been—jealous of the way Eshu looked at her, like she was something holy.
“Eshu,” Petr had whined once, “why’s she get all the special treatment?”
“Cut it out,” Eshu had said, brushing him off like a fly.
“But she’s a fucking whore!” Petr had spat, his voice dripping with venom.
Eshu had turned to him, slow and deliberate, his eyes sharp as knives. “And so are you, friend. We’re all whores in our own way, aren’t we?”
Petr had shut up after that, but the hate in him only grew, festering like an open wound.

“In the collapse of loyalty, I found the pulse of the void,” I thought, watching Petr stub out his cigarette and pull a compact mirror from his purse to fix his mascara. The void was all I’d been feeling lately—a hollow hum that wouldn’t let me go, no matter how hard I tried to drown it in whiskey or noise.

A booming voice cut through my thoughts. “Well, fuck me, you made it!” Before I could react, Yan had me in a bear hug, squeezing so hard I heard my ribs creak. The big lug was a goddamn ox—could knock out two thugs with his bare hands, and I’d seen him do it when we were on the run once. I wasn’t about to piss him off.

I wriggled out of his grip, forcing a grin, and made my way to the table. I poured myself a drink, the cheap vodka burning my throat as I knocked it back.
“Shitty weather, huh?” Eshu’s voice came from behind me, low and heavy, like he was carrying the whole damn world on his shoulders.
“Yeah, no kidding,” I said, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. “I’m covered in filth.”
“That’s not filth, Iuda,” Eshu said, his tone sharp, cutting through the haze of the room. “It’s just water.”

“That’s not filth… it’s Lilit,” he added suddenly, voice quieter, almost in trance. “She walks with the storm. She doesn’t stain, she reveals.”

I paused, a chill crawling down my spine.

“Lilit, take my hand,” he whispered. “Lilit, we begin a new chapter in the history of mankind.”

Then, just as quickly, he blinked, as if waking from something, and turned back toward the others.

I stood frozen for a moment, unsure if anyone else heard. But no one reacted.
