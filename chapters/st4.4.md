## Chapter 4: Maria’s Whisper, Iuda’s Descent

I couldn’t sit there anymore. The room was too hot, too loud, too full of ghosts. I grabbed my glass and stumbled to the couch, sitting next to Maria. She didn’t look at me, her hands still trembling, her breath shallow. Up close, I could see the bruises on her arms — yellowing, but fresh enough to make my stomach turn. Shlomo’s work, no doubt. That bastard had been breaking her for years, and we’d all let it happen.

> “Maria,” I said, my voice rough, barely above a whisper. “You okay?”

She didn’t answer, just kept staring at the floor, her fingers twisting the hem of her dress. Then, so quiet I almost missed it, she spoke.

> “I see it, Iuda. I see what you’re going to do.”

My blood ran cold.

> “What are you talking about?”

Her eyes flicked up to mine, wide and glassy, like she was looking through me.

> “You’re going to break everything. For him. For you. For me.”

*“In the rain that night, I heard a silence that spoke louder than betrayal,”* I thought, the words a hammer in my skull. She knew. She fucking knew.

> “Maria, I—”

I started, but she cut me off, her voice a trembling whisper.

> “Don’t lie to me, Iuda. I’m not stupid. I’m not… what they say I am.” 

She swallowed hard, her eyes filling with tears.

> “I’m just… tired.”

*“Silence does not erase — it archives,”* I thought, my chest tightening. Her pain was a library, and I was one of its authors. I wanted to tell her I’d stop, that I’d change the plan, that I’d save her. But the void hummed louder, and I knew I wouldn’t.

Across the room, Eshu was watching us, his face unreadable. Petr was still wiping grease off his face, muttering curses under his breath. Yan was drunk now, singing some old song about sailors, his voice slurring. Foma was gone — probably off to take a piss or call his bookie.

I leaned closer to Maria, my voice low.

> “Why don’t you leave, Maria? Get out of here. You don’t belong with us.”

She shook her head, a tear slipping down her cheek.

> “Where would I go, Iuda? Shlomo’s everywhere. And Eshu… he needs me. Even if he doesn’t say it.”

*“He said: ‘I am not leading them.’ And still, they followed,”* I thought, the paradox biting deeper. Eshu didn’t need to say it — Maria was tied to him, to us, by something stronger than words.

I reached for her hand, but she pulled away, her voice breaking.

> “Don’t touch me. Please. Just… don’t.”

I pulled back, my throat tight. The void in my chest was a scream now, tearing me apart. I was going to betray Eshu, and Maria would be the first to break when it happened. I knew it, and she knew it, and there was nothing either of us could do to stop it.
