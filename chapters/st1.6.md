###Chapter 6: FEED THE LOOP  

Ever since Mary moved in, I couldn’t think of anything else. That half-witted girl with eyes black as night hijacked my mind.  
Every spare minute — hers. I hadn’t spoken a word to her. Didn’t need to. Thinking was enough.  

Mary, I kept repeating. Mary.  
Poor hawker from the edge of town. God’s own simpleton — so simple, the word “godly” fits without strain.  

We pride ourselves on thinking. We theorize, ponder, puff our cheeks, scratch our brows.  
And you, Mary — we look up at you.
Yes — up. From below.  

What is your secret, God’s creature?  
Your clumsy grace?  
The ease with which you submit?  
The way you lift your skirt, silent, when flesh commands?  

Why “our”?  
Yakov. Peter. Andrew. Jan. Even Yeshu the knowing — all have tried you, Mary.  
I haven’t.  
I fear you’d yield to me too. Lift your skirt the same way. And that would make me one of them.  
Maybe I already am.
But I want you to think I’m not.  

Yeshu pretends not to notice how you’re used. And why should he?  
He’s married to his doctrine — loyal like a dog.  

We sit at table.  
Jan tears meat from a bone. Peter prods rice like it insulted him.  
You sit in the corner, silent.  
I don’t know if you eat. Or drink.  
My mind’s elsewhere.

Yeshu speaks. I nod. I laugh when they laugh. Toast when asked.  
But Mary — not a drop of soul in it.  
Not a flicker.  

I think of you brushing my teeth.  
I think of you falling asleep.  
I think of you on market mornings, twice a week, when I drag myself to buy fruit.  

‘How much?’ — I ask a cheerful vendor, pointing at tomatoes.  
He cuts off a joke, names the price.
I start filling my basket.  

And then I hear it — traders talking about Yeshu.  

Nothing odd — he preaches more and more. But this time, it’s not the sermons.  

It’s about Yeshu — and Mary.  

‘Kill me if you must, Moshe,’ — says the jolly vendor, ‘I don’t remember his name. I remember him talking about the soul — lonely soul — and the beard. But the name…’  
‘They called him Yeshu, Yeshu,’ — the other says.  
‘What does it matter…’  

The jolly man nods.  

‘Word is, some Mary — daughter of Shlomo — joined their gang. You know him?’  

‘Nope. Don’t know him. But she’s in for it if old Shlomo finds out.’  

‘He’s known for ages, Moshe.’ — the vendor scratches his belly. ‘Says he’s got no daughter anymore.’  
‘Fair enough. And her?’  
‘Her? Nothing. Just heard her name’s Mary. Washed some pauper Jew’s feet.’  
‘Heard he’s not a pauper Jew at all — but some rich native from Australia.
Black. Sweaty. Smells like kangaroo shit.’  

They howl with laughter.  

‘Likes walking on water!’ — Moshe grins. ‘Maybe he floats ’cause he’s part dung?’

‘Forgive me, forgive me!’ — the jolly vendor clasps his hands. ‘Feeds a thousand with two fish — such a Jew trick!’  
‘A real model of the tribe.’  
‘Yeah, I’ll ask him to buy me a Rolls-Royce — on my salary!’  
‘Ask away,’ — Moshe nods, —
‘but beware! The scammer takes a cut of every deal.’  
‘A cut? The leather seat from the new car?’  
‘No, no — the exhaust pipe. It looks like the swollen hemorrhoids of a provincial queer.’  

Another wave of laughter.  

‘Hey, remember in Police Academy —
two rookies come in covered in soot and the chief says: “What, did you two blow a bus?”’  
‘So you lied!’ — Moshe gasps. ‘You’re buying a bus, not a Rolls! For what?’ 
‘For a circus stunt. The bus gives John the Baptist a blowjob.’  
‘Maybe the other way? That’d be spicier.’  
‘I say this kike’s only fit to suck off a Boeing.’  
‘And the Boeing’s on him?’  
They crack up again — choking on their own filth.  

The talk spoils everything.  
I pay and leave.  

I walk the streets, listening —
everyone’s talking about the Teacher. Sometimes they spot me, swarm with questions.  
I slip away.  

Mary…  
I’m so sick of all this.  
Soon I’ll be home — playing that filthy role again.  
I’m tired, Mary…  

By the time I reach the house, it’s already dark.
