###Chapter 1: LILIT, TAKE MY HAND  

The peephole went dark for a little. Then a key growled in the lock.
Yakov opened the door. The dandy was in a tux with his bow-tie.  

— Ah... It's you…  
— You're right, —I said. — It's me. How's going?  
— Mm-hmm.  

Yakov stared at my feet.  

— What?  
— Shoes off. Look at you... You’ll track mud, — Yakov grumbled. — I know you don’t give a shit, but I’m the one who cleans.  
— Cleans the shit that I don't give?  

It was pouring outside; I was soaked head to toe.  

— Get in already, — Yakov said. — Everybody’s here. Even Peter. — He smirked.  
— How’s the Teacher?  
— Upset.  
— Upset? Why?  
— How would I know… — Yakov shrugged. — Says he’s got a "feeling".  
— Curious, what kind…  
— Don't know. If I knew his mind I’d be the Teacher myself.  

Classic Yakov: fussing over cleanliness and thick-headed servility to the Teacher — servility shot through with envy, dark and dull and grey.  
I hung up my coat, pulled off my shoes and my soaked socks, and crossed the creaking parquet into the sitting room.

— Peace to this house! — I scanned the gathering.  

Yes, everyone was here. Thomas sat a little apart, sneering. Andrew, as always, was meek and silent. And Mary... Mary slept softly on the couch; my eyes paused on her for a moment. Then I turned to Peter — true to form: a flamboyantly vulgar dress, a wig, cigarette held delicately by manicured fingers. His face showed nothing — no joy, no worry. Peter floated outside whatever was happening here. I don't know why the Teacher kept him among us.  

Cantankerous Peter devoured Mary with his eyes. He was jealous of her favour with the Teacher.  

“Yeshu,” Peter once asked him, “why so much honour for her?”  
“Let it go,” the Teacher waved lazily.  
“But she’s a whore.”  
“So are you… so are we all in a sense, my friend,” Yeshu said.  
“Teacher, she’s for sale, body and soul!” Peter insisted.  
“And you know her soul as well as her body?”  

Silence.  

“Answer, Peter, I’m waiting.” — Yeshu looked him dead in the eye. — “You know her soul? If yes, step right up, take my place, lead us your own way — I’ll be the first to follow.”  

Peter hated Mary all the more after that, but never argued again.
He finished his cigarette, stubbed it out, fished a mirror from his purse and started on his lashes.

— There you are! — boomed a bass behind me. — We thought you’d never come!  

Before I could react, good-natured Jan crushed me in a hug; my ribs popped.
The gentle giant had monstrous strength; once, fleeing pursuers, he’d knocked out two thugs bare-handed. I made sure to stay on his good side.
I wriggled free carefully, went to the table, poured a drink.  

— Rotten weather, eh? — came Yeshu’s voice behind me; clearly irritated.  
— Yeah — nasty stuff. I’m covered in shit.  
— Not shit, Judas. Just water.  

Allright. Got it. No time to argue. Best to filter every word.  

— Ordinary water, — Yeshu repeated. — Same as the tap, only cleaner. If it feels like shit, maybe the problem is you.  
— Me? — I couldn’t help it. — Why me?  
— Picture a bright dry day. You walk these streets, pour yourself whisky, whatever. Would you mention shit then? You wouldn’t, right?  

Jan listened wide-eyed.

— Right, — I muttered.  
— Water softens a man, my friend Judas, — Yeshu lectured. — What piles up all year becomes a flood in autumn — only instead of ice it’s shards of your soul. Moral? — The Teacher looked around.  
— Moral?! — Jan blurted, impatient.
Thomas smirked. Peter pretended not to listen.  
— Simple, — I said. — Leaving your umbrella home on a rainy day is a grave sin.  

Silence settled. Jan shook his head sadly. Peter eyed Yeshu, unsure how to react. Yakov instinctively reached for a broom.  

Yeshu’s gaze fixed on me. In a scarcely audible whisper he said:  
“Lilit, take my hand. Lilit, we’re turning the new page of humankind.”  

A chill ran through me. I wasn’t even sure I’d heard it. Yeshu blinked — as though the moment never happened.  

Then we all heard a strangled little hoot. Yeshu was laughing, then burst into full-throated roaring laughter. The sitting room shook, everyone joined in — everyone except Mary, still asleep, and Jan, who looked around in bewilderment.
