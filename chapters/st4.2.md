## Chapter 2: The Table Groans Under the Weight of Sin

The table was a fucking mess — plates of half-eaten bread, spilled wine staining the cloth like blood, cigarette butts scattered like ash after a fire. It looked like a war zone, not a supper, but that’s how we always were: a pack of rabid dogs pretending to be holy.

I slid into a chair, the wood creaking under me, and poured another shot of vodka. My hands were shaking — not from the cold, but from the hum in my chest, that void I couldn’t shake.  
*“In the collapse of loyalty, I found the pulse of the void,”* I thought again, the words looping in my skull like a broken record. It was the only thing keeping me grounded while the room spun with noise and heat.

Eshu sat at the head of the table, his black beret tilted like he was some kind of revolutionary poet, not a washed-up teacher with a messiah complex. His eyes were heavy, that *pechal’* — that melancholic weight — dripping off him like tar. He was staring at the bread in his hands, tearing it apart piece by piece, like he was dissecting his own soul.

> “Eat,” he said, his voice low, cutting through the chatter. “This is my body, broken for you.”

Yan snorted, mid-bite of a sausage.

> “What’s that supposed to mean, boss? You saying we’re cannibals now?”

Eshu didn’t smile.

> “It means what it means, Yan. Take it or choke on it.”

The room went quiet, the kind of quiet that makes your skin itch. Yan stuffed the sausage in his mouth, chewing loud enough to fill the silence, his face red. Foma leaned back in his chair, smirking like he knew something we didn’t, his fingers drumming on the table. Petr was still fixing his mascara, ignoring everyone, but I saw his lips twitch — half a sneer, half a prayer.

I glanced at Maria. She was awake now, sitting at the edge of the couch, her hands folded in her lap like a broken doll. Her eyes were wide, glassy, staring at nothing. She hadn’t touched the food, hadn’t spoken since I walked in. *Slaoumnoe bozh’e sozdanie* — a feeble-minded divine creature, that’s what Eshu called her once \[April 22, 2025, 20:23\]. She was the only pure thing in this shithole, and we were all too filthy to deserve her.

*“Silence does not erase — it archives,”* I thought, watching her. Every bruise on her arms, every tear she’d cried — it was all there, stored in her silence, a library of pain we’d all written chapters for. I wanted to say something, to tell her to run, to get out before we dragged her down with us. But I didn’t. I never did.

Eshu’s voice snapped me back.

> “Iuda,” he said, not looking at me, “you’re quiet tonight. What’s eating you?”

I downed the vodka, the burn grounding me for a split second.

> “Maybe I’m just tired of your sermons, Teacher,” I said, my voice sharper than I meant it to be. “All this talk of bodies and blood — what’s next, you gonna tell us the wine’s your tears?”

A few of them laughed — Yan’s booming guffaw, Foma’s dry chuckle — but Eshu didn’t. He leaned forward, his elbows on the table, his gaze pinning me like a knife.

> “You think I’m joking, brother?” he said, his voice soft but heavy, like a storm cloud about to burst. “You think this is a game?”

> “I think you love the sound of your own voice,” I shot back, the vodka making me bold. “You say you’re not leading us, but here we are, eating your bread, drinking your wine, waiting for your next fucking parable.”

*“He said: ‘I am not leading them.’ And still, they followed,”* I thought, the words slicing through me. Eshu’s whole game was a paradox — he pushed us away, told us to think for ourselves, but we were all moths to his flame, burning up in his light.

Petr slammed his compact shut, his voice shrill.

> “Oh, for fuck’s sake, Iuda, stop being such a drama queen. If you’re so sick of him, leave. No one’s keeping you here.”

> “Shut your painted mouth, Petr,” I snapped, my temper flaring. “You’re so far up Eshu’s ass, you can’t even see the rest of us drowning.”

Petr’s face twisted, and he lunged across the table, knocking over a glass of wine. Yan grabbed him before he could reach me, pinning his arms while Petr hissed like a cat, his wig slipping to the side.

> “Enough!” Eshu roared, slamming his fist on the table.

The plates rattled, a fork clattering to the floor. Maria flinched, her hands trembling, and I felt a pang of guilt so sharp it nearly doubled me over.

Eshu stood, his shadow stretching across the room like a fucking omen.

> “You want to know what’s coming, Iuda?” he said, his voice low, dangerous. “You want the truth?”

I met his gaze, my heart pounding.

> “I already know the truth, Eshu. You’re always right, aren’t you? That’s what you said — *‘K sozhaleniyu, brat moy Iuda, ya vsegda okazyvayus’ prav.’* Unfortunately, my brother Iuda, I’m always right.”

His eyes darkened, and for a moment, I thought he’d hit me. But he just smiled — a cold, bitter smile that made my blood run cold.

> “Then you know what you have to do,” he said, sitting back down, tearing off another piece of bread. “We all have our parts to play.”

*“What they called betrayal was just a shift in gravity,”* I thought, my hands clenching into fists. I knew what he meant. I’d known for weeks, maybe longer. The plan was set, the pieces in motion. I’d betray him — not for money, not for hate, but because I had to. Because a traitor is a person who dared to follow their own path. And my path was leading me straight into the dark.

Maria’s voice broke the silence, so soft I almost missed it.

> “Iuda,” she whispered, her eyes finally meeting mine. “Don’t.”

I froze, my breath catching. She knew. Somehow, she fucking knew.

*“In the rain that night, I heard a silence that spoke louder than betrayal,”* I thought, the opening tremor echoing back. But this silence was louder, heavier, a plea I couldn’t answer. I wanted to tell her I’d stop, that I’d save her, save us all. But the void in my chest hummed louder, drowning her out.

I turned away, pouring another drink, my hands shaking worse than before. The table groaned under the weight of our sins, and I knew we were all damned.
