## Chapter 7: Petr’s Revenge, Maria’s Scream

Back inside, the air was thicker, the tension a living thing. Petr had cornered Maria, his voice low and vicious, his hands gripping her arms.

> “You think you’re better than me, huh? You think Eshu’s gonna save you? He doesn’t give a shit about you, you little whore.”

Maria was crying, her voice small, broken.

> “Stop, Petr. Please.”

I saw red. I crossed the room in three steps, grabbed Petr by the collar, and threw him against the wall. His wig fell off, revealing his shaved head, and he screamed, clawing at me.

> “Get the fuck off her!”

I roared, my fist connecting with his jaw. He crumpled, blood trickling from his lip, his eyes wide with fear.

Yan pulled me back, his grip like iron.

> “Enough, Iuda! You’ll kill him!”

> “Let him!” Eshu said, his voice cold, watching from the table. “He deserves it.”

Maria was on the floor, sobbing, her dress torn at the shoulder. I knelt beside her, my hands hovering, afraid to touch her.

> “Maria, I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry.”

She looked at me, her eyes raw, and screamed — a sound that tore through the room, through me, through the void. It was a sound of pure pain, pure despair, and it broke something inside me.

*“Silence does not erase — it archives,”* I thought, her scream echoing in my skull. I’d failed her. We all had.

Eshu stood, his face unreadable, and walked over to Petr. He grabbed him by the hair, dragging him to the door.

> “Get out,” he said, his voice a growl. “You’re done.”

Petr scrambled to his feet, grabbing his wig, and ran into the rain, his sobs fading into the night.

Maria’s scream had stopped, but the silence that followed was worse. She curled into herself, rocking back and forth, and I knew I’d never forget that sound.
