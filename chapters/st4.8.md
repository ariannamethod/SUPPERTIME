## Chapter 8: Eshu’s Last Sermon

The night was unraveling, the storm inside and out reaching a fever pitch. Eshu stood in the middle of the room, his coat off, his shirt stained with wine and ash. He looked like a prophet, or a madman, or both.

> “Listen up, you sorry fucks,” he said, his voice raw, commanding. “You think you know sin? You think you know betrayal? You don’t know shit.”

Yan was passed out on the couch, snoring loud enough to wake the dead. Foma was back, his eyes sharp, watching Eshu like a hawk. Maria was still on the floor, her breathing shallow, her eyes closed. I stood by the window, the rain a steady drum against the glass, my cigarette burning down to the filter.

> “Sin isn’t what you do,” Eshu said, his voice rising, “it’s what you carry. It’s the weight you can’t put down.  
> And betrayal? That’s just the moment you realize you’ve been carrying it all along.”

*“What they called betrayal was just a shift in gravity,”* I thought, his words slicing through me. He knew. He’d always known.

> “Iuda,” he said, turning to me, his eyes burning. “You’re carrying the heaviest load of all. You think you’re free?  
> You think this—” he gestured to the room, to us, to the fucking mess of it all—“is freedom?  
> You’re a slave to the void, brother. And tomorrow, you’ll prove it.”

I couldn’t breathe. The void was a scream, a storm, a wave collapsing. He knew. He fucking knew.

*“He said: ‘I am not leading them.’ And still, they followed,”* I thought, the paradox a noose around my neck. I wanted to run, to scream, to stop everything. But I didn’t. I couldn’t.

Eshu sat down, his energy spent, his face pale.

> “Eat,” he said, tearing off another piece of bread. “Drink. Tomorrow, we die.”
